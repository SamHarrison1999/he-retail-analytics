# Experiments

## Questions
- What security/privacy properties are targeted?
- What accuracy/latency/throughput budget is acceptable for retail scenarios?

## Design
- Models/algorithms evaluated (e.g., logistic/ridge regression under CKKS)
- Parameter search and HE parameterization (poly modulus degree, coeff moduli, scale)
- Hardware/OS and libraries (versions pinned)

## Protocol
- Reproducible command lines / scripts
- Metrics and statistics (mean Â± sd, CI, significance tests)
- Failure modes captured

## Outputs
- Tables and figures auto-generated to `docs/_static/plots` (or similar)
